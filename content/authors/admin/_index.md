Welcome to my homepage!

I am currently a junior in [Harbin Institute of Technology](http://www.hit.edu.cn/), pursuing a Bachelor's Degree. I major in Artificial Intelligence, with an emphasis on Natural  Language Processing. Meanwhile, I conduct research as an intern at [Research Center for Social Computing and Information Retrieval (SCIR)](http://ir.hit.edu.cn/) under the guidance of Ph.D. candidate [Libo Qin](http://ir.hit.edu.cn/~lbqin/) and Prof. [Wanxiang Che](http://ir.hit.edu.cn/~car/).
